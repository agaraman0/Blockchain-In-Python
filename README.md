# Blockchain-In-Python

Implementation Of BlockChain In Python From Scratch With Your Own CrytoCurrency Like BITCOIN or Something

Build With The Help Of Python And Flask

## Dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Flask_cors
- [Pycrypto](https://pypi.org/project/pycrypto/)
- [Binascii](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
- [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/)

   Tip:Importing Classes From Different Scripts and Importing Methods Can Be An Tedious Job So Essentially Use A Code Editor Like VS Code Or Atom Something Like That

- Extras:
	
	- Working With Flask And Understanding Restfull API During Reading `node.py` can Be  Boring So Essentially Use Terminal Or any API Service Something Like Postman
	
	- Both Network UI and Node UI Both Are in `ui` Folder And Named respectively as `node.html` and `network.html`.


## Procedure:

- Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/Aman-py/Blockchain-In-Python`
- After Cloning Repository Just Simply Go In the Folder

    Example
    ```bash
    $ cd .../Blockchain-In-Python/ 
    $ python3 node.py 
    ```
- After Running This U can Simply Open Your Browser And Run Url `http://localhost:5000/#`

## Result:


### Block UI
